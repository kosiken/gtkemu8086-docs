title: Extending With Plugins
description: Add new emu8086 emulator features using plugins
---

The *gtkemu8086* emulator uses the [Libpeas](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libpeas) library to allow developers to provide extended features with plugins. 
there are already a few that are bundled with the software. 

## Adding a plugin

Currently the only supported plugin languages are Python and C, there is no support for Lua. The PluginsBox object is passed to the plugin in development.
You can access the main application window by accessing the window property on the PluginsBox object. Here are some of the public methods on the MainWindow 
object

- win.get_revealer() <br/>
    This returns the [Revealer](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkRevealer.html) widget that is seen on the main window, i.e the dock where registers are displayed 
    when a program is running

- win.get_bottom_bar() <br/>
    This returns the bottombar widget which is of the type [GtkBox](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkBox.html)

You can go through 

```python

import gi
gi.require_version('Gtk', '3.0')
from gi.repository import Gtk, Peas,GObject

class HelloWorldlugin(GObject.Object, Peas.Activatable):

    object = GObject.Property(type=GObject.Object)

    def __init__(self):
        GObject.Object.__init__(self)
        
    def do_activate(self):
        
        window = self.object.get_property("window")
        code = window.get_code()        
        window = self.object.get_property("window")
        buffer = code.get_buffer()
        buffer.set_text('db "Hello World"')
        
    def do_deactivate(self):
        print("Goodbye")    



```
