## Core Features

These are features offered out of the box by the emu8086 emulator but some
[features](#extended-features) are dependent on installed plugins. 

### Highlighting

The editor allows good quality highlighting.

No more wondering if **mon** is an *opcode* üòÅÔ∏è. The highlighting fairly covers most
 `intel x86` syntax (the one's that the emulator can handle) however it doesn't handle
 directives like `%if` and the like

### Register View

Whenever an *asm* program is running you can view the register
values to the side of the editor.

So things like 

```asm

call regDump ; are not needed

```

## Extended Features

These are features offered by plugins.
